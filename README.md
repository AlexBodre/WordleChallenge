# WordleChallenge

*Assumptions
-It is only allowed 5 letters words.
-The words have to exist (not 5 generated letters randomly).

**Hardcode
-The initial list of words is hardcoded, to avoid using api's .
-By matter of time, the implementation of the functionality to add words, doesn't validate words entered, and just let the user add one 
word at the begining of the execution.

***Not crucial to MVP
-adding CSV file as a bank of words to load every time the app start
-If you dont win, it would be good to know which word was the right one.


Ps: i'm not used to make pretty UI, but it does the job :)
